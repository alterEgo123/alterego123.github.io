## Credits

This theme is mainly built with [Jekyll][jekyllrb] ecosystem,
[Bootstrap][bootstrap], [Font Awesome][icons] and some other [wonderful tools][lib].
The avatar and favicon design come from [Clipart Max][image].

Thanks to all the [contributors][contributors]. Also, folks who submitted issues
or unmerged PRs should not be forgotten. Because they reported bugs, shared ideas,
or inspired me to write more readable documentation.

Last but not least, thanks to [JetBrains][jetbrains] for providing the
_Open Source Development_ license.
